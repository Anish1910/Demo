      "question": "What exactly is thrifting?",
      "answer": "Thrifting is shopping for secondhand clothes and goods—usually at thrift stores, vintage shops, or online platforms. You're buying pre-loved items instead of new, which saves money and is way better for the planet."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why should I thrift instead of fast fashion?",
      "answer": "Thrifting means unique pieces no one else has, saving money, and reducing waste. Fast fashion is designed to fall apart, but thrifted pieces are built to last. Plus, you're supporting sustainable fashion without the guilt."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if something is good quality?",
      "answer": "Check the fabric content, inspect seams and zippers, and feel the material. Natural fabrics like cotton, linen, and wool last longer. Look for solid construction and minimal damage. Trust your instincts—if it feels cheap, it probably is."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is thrifting only for vintage clothes?",
      "answer": "Nope! Thrifting includes vintage, but also modern secondhand pieces. You'll find designer items, high-street brands, and hidden gems all mixed in. The fun is in the hunt."
    },
    {
      "question": "What sizes do thrift stores usually carry?",
      "answer": "It varies. Most carry a range, but inventory is always different. That's why thrifting is an adventure—you might find XS or XXXL depending on the day. The key is patience and checking regularly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I really find luxury brands while thrifting?",
      "answer": "100%. People donate designer bags, shoes, and clothes all the time. You'll need patience and an eye for spotting them, but luxury secondhand is absolutely real and way cheaper."
